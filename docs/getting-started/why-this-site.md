# Why this site?

As **data scientists and engineers**, it's **easy** to find detailed **documentation on the tools and libraries** we use. But what about **end-to-end data pipeline solutions** that involve multiple products? Unfortunately, those resources can be **harder to come by**. Open source communities often don't have the resources to create and maintain them. But don't worry, that's where this website comes in!

We've created a **one-stop-shop for data practitioners** to find **recipes, reusable patterns, and actionable demos** for building **AI/ML solutions on OpenShift**. And the best part? It's a **community-driven resource site**! So, feel free to ask questions, make feature requests, file issues, and even submit PRs to help us improve the content. Together, we can make data pipeline solutions easier to find and implement.
