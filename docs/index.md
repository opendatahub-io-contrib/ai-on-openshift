Welcome to your one-stop shop for installation recipes, patterns, demos for various AI/ML tools and applications used in Data Science and Data Engineering projects running on OpenShift!

More than often, Data Scientists and Data Engineers get wonderful documentation for a specific application, library or product. But they do not often get actionable documentation and sample code on how to compose end-to-end solutions from multiple products.

The AI on OpenShift site aims at jumpstarting digital transformation productivity on the Red Hat OpenShift platform by combining practical, reusable patterns into use cases with end-to-end real world illustrations.
