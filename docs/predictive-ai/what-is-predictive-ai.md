# What is Predictive AI?

Predictive AI generally has the following characteristics:

- A model generally created based on specific or narrow set of data.
- Aims to make predictions on the likehood of an outcome, based on certain conditions and inputs.
- e.g. "how likely is this person to default on their loan in the next 5 years, given what we know about them?"
