# MLFlow

## What is it?

MLflow is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. MLflow currently offers four components:

## Helm installation into OpenShift namespace

### Pre-requisites

- Install the "Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes" operator (can be found in OperatorHub) - To store the MLFlow config
- Install the "OpenShift Data Foundation" operator (can be found in OperatorHub) - To provide S3 storage for the experiments and models

### Install

```bash
<Create an OpenShift project, either through the OpenShift UI or 'oc new-project project-name'>
helm repo add strangiato https://strangiato.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
<Log in to the correct OpenShift project through 'oc project project-name'>
helm upgrade -i mlflow-server strangiato/mlflow-server
```

#### Additional Options

The MLFlow Server helm chart provides a number of customizable options when deploying MLFlow.  These options can be configured using the `--set` flag with `helm install` or `helm upgrade` to set options directly on the command line or through a `values.yaml` file using the `--values` flag.

For a full list of configurable options, see the helm chart documentation:

##### OpenDataHub Dashboard Application Tile

As discussed in the [Dashboard Configuration](../../odh-rhoai/configuration.md#adding-a-custom-application), ODH/RHOAI allows administrators to add a custom application tile for additional components on the cluster.

The MLFlow Server helm chart supports creation of the Dashboard Application tile as a configurable value.  If MLFlow Server is installed in the same namespace as ODH/RHOAI you can install the dashboard tile run the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade -i mlflow-server strangiato/mlflow-server \
    --set odhApplication.enabled=true
```

The MLFlow Server helm chart also supports installing the odhApplication object in a different namespace, if MLFlow Server is not installed in the same namespace as ODH/RHOAI:

```bash
helm upgrade -i mlflow-server strangiato/mlflow-server \
    --set odhApplication.enabled=true \
    --set odhApplication.namespaceOverride=redhat-ods-applications
```

After enabling the odhApplication component, wait 1-2 minutes and the tile should appear in the Explorer view of the dashboard.

!!! note
    This feature requires ODH v1.4.1 or newer

### Test MLFlow

- Go to the OpenShift Console and switch to Developer view.
- Go to the Topology view and make sure that you are on the MLFlow project.
- Check that the MLFlow circle is dark blue (this means it has finished deploying).
- Press the "External URL" link in the top right corner of the MLFlow circle to open up the MLFlow UI.
- Run `helm test mlflow-server` in your command prompt to test MLFlow. If successful, you should see a new experiment called "helm-test" show up in the MLFlow UI with 3 experiments inside it.

## Adding MLFlow to Training Code

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Set tracking URI
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(“https://<route-to-mlflow>”)

# Setting the experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("my-experiment")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Enabling automatic logging for scikit-learn runs
    mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

    # Starting a logging run
    with mlflow.start_run():
        # train
```
