I hope...</p> <p>So instead, here is a simple UI that implements mostly the same code we used in the notebooks.</p> <p></p> <p>The deployment is already explained in the repo and pretty straightforward as the application will only \"consume\" the same Vector Store and LLM Serving we have used in the notebooks. However I will point out some specificities:</p> <ul> <li>This implementation allows you to have different collections in Milvus you can query from. This is fully configurable, you can create as many collections as you want and add them to the application.</li> <li>The code is more complicated than the notebooks as it allows for multiple users to use the application simultaneously. They can all use a different collection, ask questions at the same time, they stay fully isolated. The limitation is the memory you have.</li> <li>Most (if not all) parameters are configurable. They are all described in the README file.</li> </ul> <p>Some info on the code itself (<code>app.py</code>):</p> <ul> <li><code>load_dotenv</code>, along with the <code>env.example</code> file (once renamed <code>.env</code>) will allow you to develop locally.</li> <li>As normally your Milvus instance won't be exposed externally to OpenShift, if you want to develop locally you may want to open a tunnel to it with <code>oc port-forward Service/milvus-service 19530:19530</code> (replace with the name of the Milvus Service along with the ports if you change them). You can use the same technique for the LLM endpoint if you have not exposed it as a route.</li> <li>The class <code>QueueCallback</code> was necessary because the <code>vLLMOpenAI</code> library used to query the model does not return an iterator in the format Langchain expects it (at the time of this writing). Instead, this implementation of the Callback functions for the LLM puts the new tokens in a Queue (L43) that is then retrieved from continuously (L65), with the content being yielded for display. This is a little bit convoluted, but the whole stack is still in full development, so sometimes you have to be creative...</li> <li>The default Milvus Retriever (same for almost all vector databases in Langchain) does not allow to filter on the score. This means that whatever your query, some documents will always be fetched and passed into the context. This is an unwanted behavior if the query has no relation to the knowledge base you are using. So I created a custom Retriever Class, in the file <code>milvus_retriever_with_score_threshold.py</code> that allows to filter the documents according to score. NOTE: this a similarity search with a cosine score, so the lesser, the better. The threshold calculation is \"no more than...\".</li> <li>Gradio configuration is pretty straightforward trough the ChatInterface component, only hiding some buttons, adding an avatar image for the bot,... The only notable thing is the use of a State variable for the selected collection so that a switch from one collection to the other is not applied to all users (this is an early mistake I made \ud83d\ude0a) .</li> </ul> <p>Here is what you RAG-based Chatbot should look like:</p>"},{"location":"demos/podman-ai-lab-to-rhoai/podman-ai-lab-to-rhoai/","title":"From Podman AI Lab to OpenShift AI","text":"<p>Overview</p> <p>A common statement from many people today is \"I want the ability to chat with my documents\".

After all, it has been a little bit more than a year since the general public is aware of them, and many related technologies, tools or applications are only a few months, even weeks (and sometimes days!) old. So let's start with a few definitions of the different terms that will be used in this article.</p> <ul> <li>LLM: A Large Language Model (LLM) is a sophisticated artificial intelligence system designed for natural language processing. It leverages deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs use vast datasets to learn language patterns, enabling tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and more. These models are versatile and can be fine-tuned for specific applications, like chatbots or content creation. LLMs have wide-ranging potential in various industries, from customer support and content generation to research and education, but their use also raises concerns about ethics, bias, and data privacy, necessitating responsible deployment and ongoing research.</li> <li>Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a process of adapting a pre-trained, general-purpose model to perform specific tasks or cater to particular applications. It involves training the model on a narrower dataset related to the desired task, allowing it to specialize and improve performance. Fine-tuning customizes the LLM's capabilities for tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, or chatbots. This process involves adjusting hyperparameters, data preprocessing, and possibly modifying the model architecture. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to be more effective and efficient in specific domains, extending their utility across various applications while preserving their initial language understanding capabilities.</li> <li>RAG: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a framework in natural language processing. It combines two key components: retrieval and generation. Retrieval involves selecting relevant information from a vast knowledge base, like the internet, and generation pertains to creating human-like text. RAG models employ a retriever to fetch context and facts related to a specific query or topic and a generator, often a language model, to produce coherent responses. This approach enhances the quality and relevance of generated text, making it useful for tasks like question answering, content summarization, and information synthesis, offering a versatile solution for leveraging external knowledge in AI-powered language understanding and production.</li> <li>Embeddings: Embeddings refer to a technique in natural language processing and machine learning where words, phrases, or entities are represented as multi-dimensional vectors in a continuous vector space. These vectors capture semantic relationships and similarities between words based on their context and usage. Embeddings are created through unsupervised learning, often using models like Word2Vec or GloVe, which transform words into fixed-length numerical representations. These representations enable machines to better understand and process language, as similar words have closer vector representations, allowing algorithms to learn contextual associations. Embeddings are foundational in tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and recommendation systems.</li> <li>Vector Database: A vector database is a type of database designed to efficiently store and manage vector data, which represents information as multidimensional arrays or vectors. Unlike traditional relational databases, which organize data in structured tables, vector databases excel at handling unstructured or semi-structured data. They are well-suited for applications in data science, machine learning, and spatial data analysis, as they enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of high-dimensional data points. Vector databases play a crucial role in various fields, such as recommendation systems, image processing, natural language processing, and geospatial analysis, by facilitating complex mathematical operations on vector data for insights and decision-making.</li> <li>Quantization: Model quantization is a technique in machine learning and deep learning aimed at reducing the computational and memory requirements of neural networks. It involves converting high-precision model parameters (usually 32-bit floating-point values) into lower precision formats (typically 8-bit integers or even binary values). This process helps in compressing the model, making it more lightweight and faster to execute on hardware with limited resources, such as edge devices or mobile phones. Quantization can result in some loss of model accuracy, but it's a trade-off that balances efficiency with performance, enabling the deployment of deep learning models in resource-constrained environments without significant sacrifices in functionality.</li> </ul> <p>Fun fact: all those definitions were generated by an LLM...</p> <p>Do you want to know more?</p> <p>Here are a few worth reading articles:</p> <ul> <li>Best article ever: A jargon-free explanation of how AI large language models work</li> <li>Understanding LLama2 and its architecture</li> <li>RAG vs Fine-Tuning, which is best?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"generative-ai/llm-serving/#llm-serving_1","title":"LLM Serving","text":"<p>LLM Serving is not a trivial task, at least in a production environment...</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>LLMs are usually huge (several GBs, tens of GBs...) and require GPU(s) with enough memory if you want decent accuracy and performance.

If you don't know what this site is, you can think of it as what Quay or DockerHub are for containers: a big repository of models and datasets ready to download and use. Of course Hugging Face (the company) is also creating code, providing hosting capabilities,... but that's another story.</p> <p>So which model to choose will depend on several factors:</p> <ul> <li>Of course how good this model is. There are several benchmarks that have been published, as well as constantly updated rankings.</li> <li>The dataset it was trained on. Was it curated or just raw data from anywhere, does it contain nsfw material,...? And of course what the license is (some datasets are provided for research only or non-commercial).</li> <li>The license of the model itself. Some are fully open source, some claim to be... They may be free to use in most cases, but have some restrictions attached to them (looking at you Llama2...).</li> <li>The size of the model.

Fully Open Source with an Apache 2.0 license, it will fit in an unquantized version on about 22GB of VRAM, which is perfect for an A10G card.</p> <p>Embeddings are another type of model often associated with LLMs as they are used to convert documents into vectors. A database of those vectors can then be queried to find the documents related to a query you make. This is very useful for the RAG solution we are going to talk about later on.

You can skip the whole explanation, but it's worth it, so please bear with me.</p> <p>When you request resources that aren't available, the Autoscaler looks at all the MachineAutoscalers that are available, with their corresponding MachineSets.

Of course, if there is already at least one Node available from a given MachineSet, the simulation would be bypassed as the Autoscaler already knows what it will get. If there are different MachineSets that fit and to choose from, the default and only \"Expander\" available for now in OpenShift to make its decision is <code>random</code>.

If your storage does now support AZ-spanning (like AWS EBS volumes), your PV is bound to a specific AZ.

To get around this, you'll need to create a custom RHCOS template within vSphere that is preconfigured with the vGPU PCI device.

It also requires solid engineering practices, including the secure management of sensitive configuration data\u2014such as cloud credentials and authorization tokens used in platform setup.</p> <p>Since day one, we\u2019ve managed the cluster lifecycle using GitOps. However, the presence of these sensitive values meant that we initially had to keep our configuration repository private. While this worked operationally, it limited our ability to share the implementation more broadly with others.</p> <p>To address this, we adopted a secret management solution. This enabled us to decouple secrets from the GitOps-managed resources and paved the way for securely opening up parts of the platform\u2019s configuration. You can now explore the repository here to see how we run this AI platform in a secure and scalable way.</p> <p>In this post, we\u2019ll walk through the high level structure of the repository we\u2019ve opened up, what you can find inside, and how it reflects the way we run and scale OpenShift AI internally. We\u2019ll also take a closer look at the secret management approach we adopted; why we chose External Secrets Operator (ESO), how it fits into our GitOps workflow, and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>"},{"location":"odh-rhoai/secret-management/#whats-in-the-box","title":"What's In the Box?","text":"<p>The GitHub repository captures how we run production-grade AI infrastructure at scale\u2014offering reusable patterns, modular design, and automation strategies.
